# Isolation
 
This is another game, which I've made in one week. Basically, I can't even call it a game, maybe an extended prototype.

You spawn in isolated room, which is surrounded with plasma walls and your aim is to charge your core as long as you can, otherwise room will collapse.

## Controls
* W,A,S,D - Movement;
* SPACE - Dash;
* LMB - Shoot;
* E - Interact with batteries, accelerators, core.
* Q - Drop battery.
